## Cleanse with a Gentle Wash

Properly cleaning your tattoo is the first and most crucial step in aftercare. Gently wash your tattooed area with lukewarm water and a small amount of Mad Rabbit Refresh Daily Body Wash. This mild, fragrance-free cleanser is specially formulated to cleanse without causing irritation or fading. Pat the area dry with a clean, lint-free towel.

## Protect with Soothing Gel

Once your tattoo is clean and moisturized, it's time to protect it from external elements. Apply a thin, even layer of Mad Rabbit Soothing Gel to create a barrier. This transparent and breathable shield, ensures your tattoo stays protected. Reapply every 3-5 hours or as needed.

## Avoid Picking or Scratching

While your tattoo heals, it's natural for it to itch or scab. However, resist the temptation to scratch or pick at it, as it can lead to scarring or color loss. Instead, gently pat or tap the itchy area to alleviate the discomfort. The Mad Rabbit aftercare products will help soothe the itching and minimize scabbing, allowing your tattoo to heal properly.

## Stay Hydrated and Avoid Sun Exposure

Proper hydration plays a vital role in the healing process. Drink plenty of water to keep your body and skin hydrated, as this promotes faster healing and vibrant tattoo colors. Additionally, avoid exposing your tattoo to direct sunlight or tanning beds during the healing phase. UV rays can fade the colors and increase the risk of infection. If necessary, cover your tattoo with clothing or use a broad-spectrum sunscreen.

## Maintain Good Hygiene Practices

To prevent infection, it's crucial to maintain good hygiene throughout the healing process. Avoid soaking your tattoo in pools, hot tubs, or baths during the initial healing stage. Instead, opt for quick showers and gently pat the tattoo dry afterward. Avoid tight clothing or materials that may rub against your tattoo and cause irritation. Additionally, avoid applying makeup, lotions, or oils directly on your healing tattoo.

## Follow the Aftercare Routine

Consistency is key to achieving optimal results. Follow this tattoo aftercare routine using Mad Rabbit products for at least 2-4 weeks or as recommended by your tattoo artist. Remember that each tattoo is unique, so consult your tattoo artist for specific aftercare instructions tailored to your tattoo.

Caring for your new tattoo is essential to ensure it heals properly and maintains its vibrant appearance. By following this step-by-step guide and using Mad Rabbit's tattoo aftercare products, you can enjoy a beautiful, well-healed tattoo. Remember to consult your tattoo artist for personalized advice and enjoy the journey of showcasing your unique art to the world!
